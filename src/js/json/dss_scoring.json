The limitation in this case, is that the scheme can only sign a limited amount of messages (typically between 2^10 and 2^20 signatures) and it requires a different key for every signature. Applications like secure booting are ideal for these schemes, but in general it is hard to adopt stateful hash-based schemes due to the difficulty in handling the signing keys."
